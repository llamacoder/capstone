Motivation

The motivation behind this project came from Rich Maloy, who is a very successful yet very busy man.  He wanted a simple, easy to use app that would allow him to identify three items per day that were critical to his success, then remind him periodically throughout the day to focus on those tasks until they were completed.


### App Development

Check3 is the culmination of an intensive three-week development cycle to demonstrate skillsets gained during the Galvanize Web Immersive program.  The ultimate goal is to deploy a production-ready mobile-friendly app that increases the user's productivity by encouraging successful completion of three critical tasks per day.
